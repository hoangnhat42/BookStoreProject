Customer Reviews for: Blue Ocean Strategy
=========================================

Rating: 5
Headline: Blue Ocean Strategy can introduce transformation in many ways
Comment: 
Very insightful content with the best takeaway for me being the strategy of making the competition irrelevant. 
Not to ignore the competition but to understand the consumers who hire a product or service to solve a problem and differentiate your product or service to avoid commoditization.
