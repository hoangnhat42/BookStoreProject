Headline: Great book that is very easy to read and implement...
Comment: 
I love this book! I've been using it to help me find good ways to refactor my Java code. 
It's written in a way that shows you step by step on how to transition from common ways of doing things in Java 7 to the Java 8 streams way.

Headline: Unnecessarily verbose
Comment: 
Bought this book in 2017 and did not get around to using it till 2018. 
The issue I struggle with is the unnecessary verbosity in this book. (e.g., author provides a bulleted list and then prefaces each list item with firstly, secondly, thirdly etc).

Headline: this has to be one of the best I have read
Comment: 
I have read many programming books as a Java Hobbyist, this has to be one of the best I have read. 
The authors clear and concise explanation of functional programming concepts are remarkable. 
If this guys were in my town I would buy all them a beer.
