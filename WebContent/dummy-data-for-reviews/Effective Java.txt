Headline: Amazing Book
Comment: 
This is an amazing book which contains tons of good practical advice for programmers, but more importantly explains the "why" behind various things you've always heard. 
There are things I feel I understand after reading this book which I previously only "knew" on the level of a teacher saying "take my word for it."

Headline: A great explanation of not only the how, but the why
Comment: 
I read this book with almost no background in Java. I've been programming for more than a decade, so picking up the semantics of a language like Java isn't particularly time consuming. 
What DOES take time is learning best practices and developing an understanding of what makes them best practices. 
This book delivers both again and again. More than any other object of study, it accelerated my understanding of the language.
