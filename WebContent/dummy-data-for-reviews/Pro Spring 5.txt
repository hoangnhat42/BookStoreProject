Headline: Topic coverage and writing style weren't to my liking.
Comment: 
It covers a lot of topics but doesn't really go in depth the way I like. 
Maybe just a personal preference as to the way it was written. 
I also purchased the Spring 5 Recipes from the same publisher and found it to be much more useful

Headline: Great content, horrible formatting
Comment: 
Great in depth coverage of spring. Unfortunately they don't seem to have put any effort into formatting the text for the kindle version so it is difficult to read.

Headline: it's the best book to get hands on experience on Spring 5
Comment: 
In my opinion, it's the best book to get hands on experience on Spring 5.
The book is completely updated with respect to Pro Spring 4 and examines all aspects of one Enterprise Application, named Singers.
