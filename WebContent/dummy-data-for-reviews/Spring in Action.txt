Headline: Well written book
Comment: 
Easy to read in a way that helps me understand the nuts and bolts of Spring. 
I'm a computer programmer with experience in almost all areas of business applications so it's good to read about new technology (well new to me anyway).

Headline: Best Spring book available, with good coverage of Spring 4
Comment: 
Compared to "Beginning Spring" by Mert Caliskan, this is a MUCH better book. 
The examples are more substantial, and the coverage of how to go about building enterprise class applications with Spring is far more substantial.

Complete Disappointment:
After searching for weeks for a nice book for learning spring, 
I somehow decided to buy this one, mainly due to 100,000 copies being sold. 
I have completed two parts which covers spring core and spring AOP and I am appalled by the content. 
It is neither engaging nor comprehensive.
